    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mascarpone cheese</strong> 3 ⅓ cups (750 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> 5 (260 g) - (very fresh, medium)</li>
        <li><strong>Ladyfingers</strong> 8.75 oz (250 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> ⅔ cup (120 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee</strong> 1 ⅓ cup (300 g) - (made in a moka pot, with sugar to taste)</li>       
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <p>To make your tiramisu, prepare the coffee using a moka pot to get 1? cups (300 g), then add sugar to taste (we added a teaspoonful) and leave it to cool in a large, shallow bowl. 
        Separate the eggs, being careful to keep the whites totally free of yolk 1 so that they will whip well. Beat the yolks with a hand mixer, adding half of the sugar 2. 
        As soon as the mixture has turned light and foamy, and while the mixer is still running, add the mascarpone a little at a time 3.</p>

    <p>Once all the mascarpone has been added, you’ll have a dense, compact cream 4; set this aside. Clean the mixer well and move on to whipping the egg whites 5. 
        Once they’re foamy, pour in the remaining sugar a little at a time 6.</p>

    <p>Whip the whites to stiff peaks 7; you’ll know they’re ready when you can turn the bowl upside down without the mixture moving. Take a spoonful of the whites and add it to the bowl with the mascarpone cream 8, then stir vigorously with a spatula to dilute the mixture. 
        Next, add the rest of the egg whites little by little, folding them in by mixing very gently from the bottom upwards 9. </p>

    <p>The mascarpone cream is ready 10. Spread a heaping spoonful on the bottom of a glass baking dish measuring 9x13 inches (20x30 cm), ensuring the entire base is covered 11. 
        Now dip the ladyfingers into the cold coffee for a few seconds, first on one side and then on the other 12. </p>
    
    <p>Then arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers in the dish 13, trying to position them all in one direction, to form a first layer of cookies 14. 
        Add another layer of mascarpone cream and level it so the cookies are covered completely 15. </p>
    
    <p>Continue to add the coffee-soaked ladyfingers 16 and cream 17 in alternating layers, always leveling the surface of the cream 18.</p>

    <p>Finally, transfer the remaining cream to a pastry bag with a ½-inch (12-mm) plain tip and cover the entire surface of the tiramisu with dabs of cream 19. 
        Sprinkle over the unsweetened cocoa powder 20 and leave the tiramisu to set in the fridge for a couple of hours. Your tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed 21!</p>
