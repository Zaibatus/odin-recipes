    <p>Tiramisu is one of the cornerstones of Italian cuisine, one of the best-loved and most frequently made desserts in the entire world. 
        The origins of tiramisu aren’t entirely clear and more than one city claims to be its birthplace. What we do know for sure, however, is that since 1980, when its name entered into the Italian vocabulary, tiramisu has been a huge hit! 
        Nowadays, it’s one of the most well-known Italian words abroad. But what makes tiramisu so special? We definitely love the fact that it’s so easy to make, with an irresistibly tasty, velvety mascarpone cream layered with ladyfingers soaked in coffee. Some people like to flavor the glaze with Marsala wine, while others prefer to use different liqueurs, but we love it just the way it is, in the purest form, so today we’re bringing you the classic version that’s perfect for any occasion! Although we still haven’t found out exactly who invented the present-day version of tiramisu – some say it’s Ado Campeol, the owner of the famous and history-filled bar Il Becchiere in Treviso – that won’t stop us from sharing our recipe for one of the best tiramisus you’ll ever try! 
        Make it yourself and let us know what you think.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mascarpone cheese</strong> 3 ⅓ cups (750 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong> 5 (260 g) - (very fresh, medium)</li>
        <li><strong>Ladyfingers</strong> 8.75 oz (250 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong> ⅔ cup (120 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Coffee</strong> 1 ⅓ cup (300 g) - (made in a moka pot, with sugar to taste)</li>       
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>To make your tiramisu, prepare the coffee using a moka pot to get 1? cups (300 g), then add sugar to taste (we added a teaspoonful) and leave it to cool in a large, shallow bowl. 
            Separate the eggs, being careful to keep the whites totally free of yolk 1 so that they will whip well. Beat the yolks with a hand mixer, adding half of the sugar 2. 
            As soon as the mixture has turned light and foamy, and while the mixer is still running, add the mascarpone a little at a time 3.</li>
        <li>Once all the mascarpone has been added, you’ll have a dense, compact cream 4; set this aside. Clean the mixer well and move on to whipping the egg whites 5. 
            Once they’re foamy, pour in the remaining sugar a little at a time 6.</li>
        <li>Whip the whites to stiff peaks 7; you’ll know they’re ready when you can turn the bowl upside down without the mixture moving. Take a spoonful of the whites and add it to the bowl with the mascarpone cream 8, then stir vigorously with a spatula to dilute the mixture. 
            Next, add the rest of the egg whites little by little, folding them in by mixing very gently from the bottom upwards 9.</li>
        <li>The mascarpone cream is ready 10. Spread a heaping spoonful on the bottom of a glass baking dish measuring 9x13 inches (20x30 cm), ensuring the entire base is covered 11. 
            Now dip the ladyfingers into the cold coffee for a few seconds, first on one side and then on the other 12.</li>
        <li>Then arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers in the dish 13, trying to position them all in one direction, to form a first layer of cookies 14. 
            Add another layer of mascarpone cream and level it so the cookies are covered completely 15.</li>
        <li>Continue to add the coffee-soaked ladyfingers 16 and cream 17 in alternating layers, always leveling the surface of the cream 18.</li>
        <li>Finally, transfer the remaining cream to a pastry bag with a ½-inch (12-mm) plain tip and cover the entire surface of the tiramisu with dabs of cream 19. 
            Sprinkle over the unsweetened cocoa powder 20 and leave the tiramisu to set in the fridge for a couple of hours. Your tiramisu is ready to be enjoyed 21!</li>
