First HTML project as part of The Odin Project curriculum.

In this project, I'm going to build a basic recipe website (but with actually good recipes)

By the end, I will demostrate my ability to use Git, write committments, create a webpage in HTML with links, images, different text formatting ecc... I will adjusting the style later on in the CSS session.
